      "With <b>more than 15 years experience in software development</b>, I became an entrepreneur after spending more than half of my career as an IT consultant for companies in various industries (banking, insurance, energy, utilities, media, sports...) and of various sizes (from small companies to multinationals).",
      "In my last experience before my entrepreneurial leap, I was <b>CTO</b> of an IT consulting company for more than 3 years, in parallel to my <b>software developer</b> and <b>senior consultant</b> role.",
      "<b>Designing high quality software is my passion, and I like to be proud of the work I do</b>. In addition to my mandates, I spend a lot of time constantly training myself to stay on top of the latest technologies, in order to be able to provide the best solutions to your various problems.",

      "I had the opportunity to be a speaker in major technical conferences such as Devoxx in France or Web À Québec.",
      "In 2018, I made the decision to emigrate from France to settle in Montreal, Quebec. After many peregrinations in the different Quebec regions, and having a strong attraction for the countryside and nature, <b>I fell in love with Charlevoix region</b>, bordered on one side by the magnificent Saint-Laurent river and on the other by the majestic Laurentides mountain range.",
      "I decided to make the move in 2022 by leaving Montreal to settle in Charlevoix-Est, in the city of Clermont. It is then that I decided to launch myself in the entrepreneurial adventure, to <b>use my skills and my expertise for the local companies</b>.",
      "My other passions? Hiking in the Quebec countryside, and wildlife and landscape photography."
